Abstract: BACKGROUND: College students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and they frequently encounter barriers to seeking traditional mental health treatments. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the literature on digital mental health interventions focused on depression, anxiety, and enhancement of psychological well-being among samples of college students to identify the effectiveness, usability, acceptability, uptake, and adoption of such programs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number CRD42018092800), and the search strategy was conducted by a medical research librarian in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) from the date of inception to April 2019. Data were synthesized using a systematic narrative synthesis framework, and formal quality assessments were conducted to address the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 89 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions (71/89, 80%) were delivered via a website, and the most common intervention was internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (28, 31%). Many programs (33, 37%) featured human support in the form of coaching. The majority of programs were either effective (42, 47%) or partially effective (30, 34%) in producing beneficial changes in the main psychological outcome variables. Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did not present any usability or acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses. Quality assessments revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that digital mental health interventions can be effective for improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being among college students, but more rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the effective elements of these interventions. Continued research on improving the user experience of, and thus user engagement with, these programs appears vital for the sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses.

Abstract: Aim: Informal caregivers have an important role in bridging the gap between the assistance care recipients need and what can be provided by the health care systems across Europe. The burden of the caregiving role places a significant threat to caregiver health, and the vast majority of caregiver's report stress and emotional strain, depression, and increased rates of chronic diseases. In line with this, strengthening the caregiver's mental health is one of the main goals for optimal caregiving. Caregivers already struggle with the demand of their role while coping with health problems, social, family, and work obligations. The solution for the caregiver's mental health needs to be accessible, low cost, and time-effective. This scoping review investigates digital mental health tools available as a mean of supporting the mental health of caregivers. Method: Databases searched include Summon search box, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed. Three groups of keywords were combined: relating to digital mental health interventions for caregivers, digital mental health interventions and stress in elderly care, and digital mental health interventions and burden in elderly care. Results: Caregivers reported that digital mental health tools have an overall positive role in their health. Coping skills, emotion regulation, skill building, and education are found to be important aspects of digital mental health tools. There was a noted lack of digital mental health apps available specifically for the caregiver of older adults. Furthermore, the digital mental health tools, divided into three categories in this review, focused either on building skills or educating caregivers and assisting with the duties rather than the mental health of the caregiver itself. As repeatedly suggested in the reviewed studies, digital mental health interventions overall contribute to reducing the caregiver burden with a limitation of addressing one aspect of caregiver needs -i.e., specific coping skills or education regarding illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and Dementia. The lack of all-encompassing, data and theory-driven digital mental health tools for addressing and supporting the caregiver's mental health is evident.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Poor mental health among university students remains a pressing public health issue. Over the past few years, digital health interventions have been developed and considered promising in increasing psychological wellbeing among university students. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence on digital health interventions targeting university students and to evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2021 searching PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting university students. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO [CRD42021234773]. RESULTS: The initital literature search resulted in 806 records of which seven remained after duplicates were removed and evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Effectiveness was reported and categorized into the following six delivery types: (a) web-based, online/computer-delivered interventions (b) computer-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), (c) mobile applications and short message service (d) virtual reality interventions (e) skills training (f) relaxation and exposure-based therapy. Results indicated web-based online/computer delivered-interventions were effective or at least partially effective at decressing depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorder symptoms. This was similar for skills-training interventions, CBT-based intervention and mobile applications. However, digital mental health interventions using virtual reality and relaxation, exposure-based therapy was inconclusive. Due to the variation in study settings and inconsistencies in reporting, effectiveness was greatly dependent on the delivery format, targeted mental health problem and targeted purpose group. CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for the beneficial effect of digital mental health interventions for university students. However, this review calls for a more systematic approach in testing and reporting the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions.

Abstract: The modern context of mental health interventions asks for an inclusion of digital solutions to the face-to-face approach, providing better access and reduced inequity for patients. The current classification of digital mental health interventions can be system specific (mobile apps) or general (virtual therapy), which causes inadequacy in applications. The goal of this study was to develop a framework to improve digital mental health interventions classification. We performed a rapid review of the literature on existing digital mental health interventions frameworks. We identified four existing frameworks, extracted their purpose, categories and items, completed a thematic analysis and formulated a four domains framework proposal. This framework allows to classify digital mental health interventions on their system, function, time and facilitation, which should facilitate our understanding of the effect of singular characteristics on patient outcomes.

Abstract: AIM: School teachers face the paradox of being in a privileged position to act in youth mental health prevention, but in a vulnerable position for not receiving adequate training and personal support. Digital interventions can provide unexpensive tools and narrow this gap in a large scale without major structural changes. We aimed to synthesize the evidence for digital mental health interventions for school teachers. METHODS: Studies published from any date until August 2022 were identified through a literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, ScIELO, and Cochrane Central databases. The studies included evaluated digital interventions targeting school teachers to deal with their own mental health or to assist them in the management of students' mental health. Studies that addressed school-based digital mental health interventions, but directly targeted students, parents, or specifically other professionals were not included. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 5626 hits and several interventions were described, but only 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, none of which focused on teachers' mental health. There was some evidence that these interventions improved knowledge about general or specific topics in mental health, and most studies also reported gains in preparedness, confidence, and attitudes towards mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The studies identified in this review provide initial support for teacher-focused mental health digital interventions. However, we discuss limitations regarding study designs and data quality. We also discuss barriers, challenges, and the need for effective evidence-based interventions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although mental health difficulties are common in people with epilepsy, their assessment and treatment are rarely incorporated into routine medical care, with detrimental effects on quality of life. Several barriers to access traditional face to face interventions have been identified, including travel restriction and shortage of appropriately trained mental health clinicians. Digital mental health interventions offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment. The main aim of the present study is to systematically review the empirical literature to identify what digital mental health interventions for adults, children and young people with epilepsy are currently available, as well as exploring if these interventions are effective in improving mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: Searches were conducted using the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Embase. The reference lists of papers collected were examined in order to identify any further relevant articles cited in peer-reviewed journals. A total of 1490 papers were identified; of these 11 were included in this review. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022318658) and the PRISMA 2020 statement was followed. RESULTS: Seven digital interventions were identified. All interventions were based predominantly on CBT and mindfulness techniques and showed promising results in reducing symptoms of depression, with some studies also reporting encouraging results in reducing anxiety and improving satisfaction with life and the quality of life of adults and children and young people with epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, digital mental health interventions for people with epilepsy seem to be effective and have the potential to improve access to psychological interventions and reach underserved clinical populations. However, further well-powered and methodological rigorous studies are needed to confirm the effect of such interventions for people with epilepsy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 5 adolescents experience a mental health disorder each year; yet because of barriers to accessing and seeking care, most remain undiagnosed and untreated. Furthermore, the early emergence of psychopathology contributes to a lifelong course of challenges across a broad set of functional domains, so addressing this early in the life course is essential. With increasing digital connectivity, including in low- and middle-income countries, digital health technologies are considered promising for addressing mental health among adolescents and young people. In recent years, a growing number of digital health interventions, including more than 2 million web-based mental health apps, have been developed to address a range of mental health issues. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on digital health interventions targeting adolescents and young people with mental health conditions, aged between 10-24 years, with a focus on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability to low-resource settings (eg, low- and middle-income countries). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases between January 2010 and June 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting adolescents and young people aged between 10-24 years. Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews. RESULTS: In this systematic overview, we included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found evidence on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression, whereas the effectiveness of other digital mental health interventions remains inconclusive. Interventions with an in-person element with a professional, peer, or parent were associated with greater effectiveness, adherence, and lower dropout than fully automatized or self-administered interventions. Despite the proposed utility of digital interventions for increasing accessibility of treatment across settings, no study has reported sample-specific metrics of social context (eg, socioeconomic background) or focused on low-resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: Although digital interventions for mental health can be effective for both supplementing and supplanting traditional mental health treatment, only a small proportion of existing digital platforms are evidence based. Furthermore, their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness, including in low- and middle-income countries, have been understudied. Widespread adoption and scale-up of digital mental health interventions, especially in settings with limited resources for health, will require more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vis-a-vis the type of service provided, target population, and the current standard of care.

Three groups of keywords were combined: relating to digital mental health interventions for caregivers, digital mental health interventions and stress in elderly care, and digital mental health interventions and burden in elderly care. Results: Caregivers reported that digital mental health tools have an overall positive role in their health. Coping skills, emotion regulation, skill building, and education are found to be important aspects of digital mental health tools. There was a noted lack of digital mental health apps available specifically for the caregiver of older adults. Furthermore, the digital mental health tools, divided into three categories in this review, focused either on building skills or educating caregivers and assisting with the duties rather than the mental health of the caregiver itself. As repeatedly suggested in the reviewed studies, digital mental health interventions overall contribute to reducing the caregiver burden with a limitation of addressing one aspect of caregiver needs –i.e., specific coping skills or education regarding illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and Dementia.
LIMITATIONS The lack of clear guidance about the efficacy of the mental health interventions delivered via digital tools explored in this review is considered the main limitation of this review. Namely, the majority of reviewed studies emphasized the effectiveness and success of the digital tool without reflecting on the therapeutic background or rationale for using a specific therapeutic approach for certain mental health issues. Although this review explored the usability of digital mental health tools among caregivers of older adults and the types of digital mental health tools currently available, it cannot provide any definitive conclusion about the efficacy of the interventions distributed through digital mental health tools as well as the caregivers’ preferences when it comes to the type of digital mental health tools available. It could be the case that the interventions that had higher therapeutic potential were delivered in a way that was less convenient for the caregiver or the digital mental health tool used was not the best option for delivering the specific intervention. Although several studies reported the success of digital mental health tools used, there was no clear checklist followed, and only one study provided follow-up results. Moreover, the comparison between the digital mental health tools available has not been made in any papers, therefore it cannot definitively be concluded that one digital mental health tool or a specific type of technology is more successful than the other.
Caregivers, on the other hand, seem to be the disregarded majority. The reviewed studies reported that the caregivers, when asked to, were able to provide suggestions and describe the digital mental health technology they need in order to improve their well-being. This indicates that there is a clear lack of practical approach in creating digital mental health tools, content, and interventions, by simply involving caregivers in the creation of technology intended for them. In line with this, the development of digital mental health tools such as digital mental health intervention or generally positive technology for dealing with caregiver burden, besides scientific theoretical background, may also include caregiver suggestions and preferences since they have the most experience with caregiving and the mental health needs they develop over a course of role. The main literature gap in this area of research is mostly centered around the lack of conclusive evidence and clear explanations regarding the effectiveness and therapeutic design in existing digital mental health tools addressing adverse mental health issues caregivers face throughout their role. Out of 16 reviewed papers, only a small portion provided clear the therapeutic rationale behind the interventions used.
Moreover, according to the results obtained in this review, digital mental health tools for caregivers that provide coping skills, emotional self-regulation skills, education about caregiving, skill-building and skill training in a well-structured approach are the most successful in managing caregiver stress and burden. Finally, digital mental health tools, including webbased, mobile apps, or virtual reality solutions, have the potential to reshape health care due to its ability to be structured in a therapeutic way, providing interventions for a wide variety of caregivers regardless of their age and personality characteristics, through video, audio, text and interactive content. Due to its affordability, accessibility, adaptability, and ability to deliver structured and therapeutically based interventions, digital mental health tools can be considered as potential next step support for informal caregivers. skills, emotional self-regulation, education, skill-building, and skill training. In other words, caregivers benefited and showed improved well-being, lowered levels of stress and burden and increased emotional regulation after they were educated about the caregiving role, and they were given certain skills to manage their mental health and well-being while providing care. Teaching caregivers coping skills and emotional self-regulation is an important aspect of the reviewed digital mental health tools and can be argued as an important factor in the overall positive results achieved in the studies reviewed.
The results indicated several important points that can be used in further reviews, as well as important points that can guide future digital mental health tools development. These points include important aspects that were successfully included in the digital mental health tools reviewed: coping generally in more distress due to caregiving tasks . It has been shown that culturally-adapted digital tools are the right approach for educating caregivers, improving coping skills and motivation to care . There was an evident lack of digital mental health tools aiming to support the mental health of the caregivers of older care recipients with overall 44 apps promoted on the market as such, while only eight of these addressed additional categories besides information and resources, communication and caregiverrecipient interaction . Furthermore, the majority of digital mental health tools are strongly focused on improving the caregiving role itself, which benefits care-recipients the most. The digital tools available center on specific limitations or illnesses such as Dementia or Parkinson’s disease, without offering the all-encompassing digital mental health tool for caregivers.

Consequently, to increase facility capacity and to provide mental health counselling to all students in need, universities across the globe have started to implement digital mental health interventions. Digital mental health interventions have been widely acknowledged to have the potential to alleviate some of these accessibility barriers, which have been exhibited across various populations i.e., older adults and children . Digital mental health interventions are mental health support that is delivered via web-based or mobile-based platforms, which further denotes itself as eHealth and mHealth interventions . This includes successfully adapted web-or mobile-based delivery of evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioural trials. Studies have reported that digital mental health interventions can effectively treat depression, anxiety, sleep, stress, alcohol use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders and eating disorders amongst college students . Young people are considered one of the most connected groups due to their exposure to digital communications .
Digital mental health interventions have helped to overcome issues of scheduling conﬂicts, waitlist, inaccessibility, and added expenses . Additionally, it allows individuals to avoid stigmatization of seeking mental health care by giving them a sense of ownership with their respective issues and facilitating help-seeking behaviours . However, evidence also points to concerns among students when it comes to digital mental health interventions. These include, for instance, concerns about privacy, developer credibility, and lack of guidance with digital mental health interventions. Acknowledging that user engagement could play a role in effectiveness, many studies have yet to assess this, which has been supported as future directions by other reviews . Conceptualizing user experiences can enhance the personalization of digital mental health interventions, which has been shown to improve uptake, retention, and outcomes .
Effectiveness has been determined amongst patients in Swedish clinical trials of internet-delivered CBT , veterans , and older adults . Reviews investigating digital mental health interventions amongst young people have found small effects in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms , with speciﬁc effectiveness of computer-based CBT interventions . Nevertheless, within the context of young adults, who represent one of the most connected groups, digital mental health interventions are a promising tool and can help overcome structural and psychological barriers that university students may face when seeking mental health counselling. Moreover, students have reported that digital mental health services are convenient and easy to use . Digital mental health interventions have helped to overcome issues of scheduling conﬂicts, waitlist, inaccessibility, and added expenses . Additionally, it allows individuals to avoid stigmatization of seeking mental health care by giving them a sense of ownership with their respective issues and facilitating help-seeking behaviours .
Studies have reported that digital mental health interventions can effectively treat depression, anxiety, sleep, stress, alcohol use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders and eating disorders amongst college students . Young people are considered one of the most connected groups due to their exposure to digital communications . They have also reported a preference for the internet as a source of seeking health-related information to address or solve personal health problems and concerns . The effectiveness of digital mental health interventions among university students is a growing ﬁeld of research, with more publications focusing on the efﬁcacy for improving symptoms of various mental health problems and enhancing psychological wellbeing, being published each year. Thus, the main objective of this umbrella review is to critically evaluate, synthesize, and summarize available reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effectiveness of various digital mental health interventions amongst university students. MATERIALS AND METHODS This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) , which helps review authors to improve the reporting of their systematic review and/or meta-analysis and guidelines developed by Aromataris et al.
CONCLUSIONS This review supports the potential of digital mental interventions in overcoming the pressing mental health problems present amongst university students who actively use the interventions. Digital mental health interventions could be an effective alternative in dealing with current challenges and barriers faced by university students when seeking assistance with their mental health problems. Future studies should investigate user engagement and retention rates amongst university students to ensure sustainable effects and appropriate implementation of interventions.

Digital mental health interventions, including those delivered via the web and apps, have shown promise in improving access to mental health treatment for various populations, such as college students and caregivers of older adults (PMID: 31333198, 32411643). These interventions have been effective in addressing common mental health issues like depression, anxiety, stress, and improving psychological well-being (PMID: 31333198, 37001253). The use of digital tools, such as cognitive behavioral therapy delivered online, has demonstrated positive outcomes in reducing symptoms and improving satisfaction with life (PMID: 37001253).

Additionally, the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for adolescents and young people has been explored, showing potential in addressing mental health disorders early in life and reaching underserved clinical populations (PMID: 33913817). Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy has been effective in managing anxiety and depression in this population, emphasizing the importance of interventions with an in-person element or professional involvement for greater effectiveness (PMID: 33913817).

While digital mental health interventions offer benefits such as increased accessibility, reduced stigma, and improved user engagement, there are also challenges to address, including concerns about privacy, developer credibility, and the need for more rigorous studies to confirm their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low-resource settings (PMID: 31333198, 35612165, 33913817). Continued research and development in this field are necessary to optimize the user experience, assess the long-term effectiveness, and ensure sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions across diverse populations (PMID: 31333198, 35612165, 33913817).
